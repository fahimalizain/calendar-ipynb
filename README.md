## On Overlapping Events

Let's assume we have the following events on the same day:
- Event 1: 10AM - 11AM
- Event 2: 10AM - 10:15AM
- Event 3: 10:15AM - 10:30AM
- Event 4: 10:30AM - 11AM

The duration of each events will be calculated as follows:
- Event 1: 1hr - 7.5min (Event 2) - 7.5min (Event 3) - 15min (Event 4) = 30min
